                The gradient nearest neighbor (GNN) imputation mapping approach has been used to develop wall-to-wall,
                30-m resolution vegetation maps for forests in western North America, focusing primarily on
                California, Oregon, and Washington. However, GNN users must have substantial analytical expertise
                and computational resources to effectively leverage these data. This may be a significant barrier for
                many interested parties. For example, the most recently available
                <a href="http://lemma.forestry.oregonstate.edu/data/structure-maps" target="_blank">GNN structure
                    maps</a>
                are roughly 1 GB in size. The recent development of annual maps stretching back to the early days
                of Landsat 5 (1985 to 2012) means that every pixel (900 m<sup>2</sup>) has 28 annual estimates of
                each of 333 structure variables associated with it. As a result, users are faced by [28 years] × [333
                variables] × [1.8×10<sup>9</sup> pixels] = 1.7×10<sup>13</sup> predictions they might summarize
                across space and time. This quantity of data can be truly daunting. To simplify users’ introduction
                to the GNN data and facilitate data exploration, we have developed the GNN Trend and Accounting
                Explorer (GNN TrAccEr), a web-based platform for visualizing and exporting landscape- and
                regional-scale data summaries.

            <p>
                While the purpose of the GNN TrAccEr is to simplify the user’s introduction to GNN data, there are
                significant challenges to using and interpreting the summarized results presented by the tool. Below,
                we provide several links to additional information about the GNN TrAccEr and the GNN method itself.

        <div class="content small-panel">
            <p>
                The GNN TrAccEr can be thought of as two different components: 1) a background analysis script and 2) a
                web-based visualization tool. For the background analysis component, we combine rasters that represent
                strata (e.g. ownership, land-use allocation, etc.) together with the full time series of GNN rasters
                (1985-2012) so that all unique combinations of strata are calculated for every year. This can be a
                time-consuming processing task depending on the number of strata and the geographic extent of the
                rasters (up to 12 hours). Once these are calculated, the yearly files are combined into a single
                comma-delimited, or CSV, file where every record represents a unique strata combination for a given
                year and captures the response variable information for the requested GNN variables, including area.
            </p>
            <p>
                The CSV file is combined with a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) file (which provides configuration
                options and metadata) and placed on the web server. The web-based visualization tool reads the
                JSON configuration file, dynamically builds the user interface, and provides logic for summarizing
                across unique combinations of strata and providing interactive charting to the user. Note that the
                web-based visualization is not specific to GNN data – one should be able to adapt this tool for
                summarizing data from any trend-based model or simulation.

            Using the GNN TrAccEr
        </div>
        <div class="content large-panel">
            <p>
                The front-end of the GNN TrAccEr (i.e., web-based visualization) is quite flexible, allowing for
                a wide degree of customization for individual user groups. Examples will be available soon on
                an archiving website. Regardless of which configuration of the GNN TrAccEr is used, there are several
                steps to using the tool and understanding the data presented. As we describe how to use the GNN
                TrAccEr, we will use an example configuration (below) of the tool designed to explore stand biomass
                across Oregon through time.

                    <span class="list-item-heading">Tool layout</span>. The GNN TrAccEr is organized into two
                    sections: the upper portion of the window that allows the user to define how to organize the
                    data and the lower portion where the trends are summarized and plotted. In the upper portion,
                    links to the left control how the data are stratified while links on the right control the
                    sub-setting of the data into different series, altering the range of years, changing the
                    variable of interest, and exporting the trend information as a comma-delimited file.

                    <span class="list-item-heading">Stratifying data</span>. Initially, all data are combined
                    together to provide the mean of a variable of interest or the area the data cover. To focus
                    on only certain strata, the user can click on one of the Focus Areas (e.g., <em>Model Region</em>).
                    A dialog box will appear and, when the empty field is selected, a dropdown of strata appears. Any
                    number of these can be selected. Finally, the user needs to select “OK” to use only these strata.
                    <img src="images/traccer-stratum-dialog-800px.png" class="doc-image"/>
                    There are two types of strata that have different effects on trends in the data: strata defined
                    based on the GNN data itself and strata defined by other spatial coverages (i.e., non-GNN strata).
                    In the current example, <em>Model Region</em>, <em>Ownership</em>, and <em>Land allocation</em>
                    are non-GNN strata and <em>Old growth – 80</em> and <em>Old growth – 200</em> are GNN variables.

                            <span class="list-item-heading">GNN strata</span>. Stratification
                            based on GNN strata are useful for examining changes in the
                            area of vegetation features through time as the GNN data vary from year to year as a
                            function of the changes in the satellite imagery. Examination of response
                            variables relates to the average state on that GNN strata through time. However, the strata
                            and response variables may not be independent. In the current example, old-growth forests
                            (i.e., classified as Old growth – 200) tend to have higher biomass than forests without.

                            strata are useful for examining changes in response variables (e.g., biomass) through
                            time. Currently, non-GNN strata are not allowed to vary through time so that area for
                            each non-GNN strata is constant.

                            one strata (both GNN and non-GNN strata) can be used for both trends in area or
                            response variables, though users should take care when interpreting these combinations
                            and think about how those results relate to the strata being used.  For more information,

                    several strata in the same figure. To the right, the series is defined and can be changed by
                    clicking on the current series definition. Then, the user can select any of the strata, which
                    will present results for each strata within the series separately. For example, for <em>Land
                    allocation</em>, different trends are presented for the mean conditions or area for multi-resource
                    allocations, Private-OFRA allocations, etc.

            <p>
                The GNN TrAccEr is flexible and easy to use, but users should take care when interpreting the trends.
                In particular, several questions should always be in users’ minds:
            </p>
            <ul class="ui list">
                <li>
                    <span class="list-item-heading">Should the vegetation trends of interest be captured over broad
                        geographic areas?</span>
                    Users should think carefully about whether the change they are attempting to examine is large
                    enough to be captured at the level of the strata being used. For example, the impacts of
                    disturbance events on broad-scale temporal trends in forest attributes presented by the GNN
                    TrAccEr depends on the size of strata and the size of the disturbance. The Biscuit Fire (2002)
                    covered over 2000 km<sup>2</sup> and altered forest structure across a large portion of southwest
                    Oregon. As a result, substantial trends in forest structure (e.g., forest area with old-growth
                    structure index > 200) are clear and large relative to their initial values (approximately
                    30% reduction) (see below).
                    <img src="images/traccer-ogsi200-area-800px.png" class="doc-image"/>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="list-item-heading">Are the vegetation trends dramatic?</span> For most elements of
                    vegetation structure and composition, change is usually slow (e.g., biomass increases as trees
                    grow, species turnover as forest succession progresses, etc.). However, disturbance events, such
                    as wildfire, timber harvesting, insect and disease outbreak, alter forest conditions rapidly over
                    the course of days to years. At broad scales, slow, subtle trends may be difficult to capture
                    and may be hard to differentiate from stable behavior (i.e., no change).

                <li>
                    <span class="list-item-heading">Are area estimates or continuous attributes most appropriate?</span>
                    The selection of appropriate response variables to plot trends of is a key decision and requires
                    some thought. For non-GNN strata, areas do not change through time as we use a single raster to
                    represent these strata. Because estimates of areas will be static, trends in non-area response
                    variables are appropriate. For GNN strata, the opposite is true because GNN strata change annually
                    with imagery, making area estimates interpretable (e.g., how has area of old-growth changed?),
                    but examination of other response variables difficult. For example, if we plot mean OGSI for
                    old-growth forests in each physiographic province (see below), we are looking at a chart that
                    tells us how OGSI changes in forests with OGSI similar to forests with stand age greater than
                    200. How does one interpret this chart? Is the old-growthiness of old-growth changing over time?
                    <img src="images/traccer-ogsi200-mean-800px.png" class="doc-image"/>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="list-item-heading">Is the trend ecologically meaningful?</span> Users need to be
                    well-aware of what constitutes an ecologically meaningful change in a response variables. For
                    example, if we create a chart to look at mean canopy cover on USFS lands in Oregon and Washington
                    (USFS-R6) for the East Cascades of Oregon (Phys. Province 203) we might see dramatic
                    fluctuations (see below), but once one looks at the scale of the response variable, it becomes
                    clear that these fluctuations may not be of much importance (range of canopy covers is 2%).
                    Therefore, users should carefully examine the scale of the response variables before trying to
                    interpret a perceived pattern.

                    Since the inception of GNN, there has been a heavy focus on accuracy assessment to inform users
                    as to the limitations of the data. Those same uncertainties are likely to be translated into

            The LEMMA group recognizes that user interest in GNN data arises from diverse questions. Consequently,
            there will be a need for the construction of various trend configurations designed to answer different
            questions. In addition, some users may wish to develop novel features, such as modifying the code

            and JSON files and are willing, to the extent that time allows, to work with others to offer versions of
            the GNN TrAccEr for new and interesting questions.
